# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in your browser.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. After each move, the game automatically checks for a win or a draw.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click on the grid cells to make your move.
- **Automatic Result Checking:** The game detects winning combinations and draws.
- **Dynamic Display:** Shows the current player's turn and announces the result when the game ends.
- **Reset Functionality:** Restart the game at any time using the Reset button.
- **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the game board and UI elements.
- **CSS3:** For styling the grid, buttons, and overall layout.
- **JavaScript:** For game logic, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**  
   Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. **Open the `index.html` File:**  
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Start Playing:**  
   Click on the grid cells to play. The current player's turn is displayed at the top. Click the Reset button to start a new game.

## How It Works

- **Game Start:**  
  Player X always starts the game.

- **Game Flow:**  
  Clicking on an empty cell marks it with the current player's symbol (X or O). After each move, the game checks for winning conditions or a draw.

- **Display:**  
  The "display-player" section shows whose turn it is, and the "announcer" section displays the result (win or draw) at the end.

- **Reset:**  
  Clicking the Reset button clears the board and resets the game state.
